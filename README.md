# SafHer
SafHer is a web based application that provides map based features for women to take extra precaution to stay safer, especially if they need to travel alone in unfamiliar areas. 

Look up a location and view how safe it is based on:
1. Neighbourhood locality - how much residential accommodation is present
2. Proximity of Police Stations
3. Safety ratings given by other women based on their experience in that area

Safety rating - unsafe, moderately safe, most safe areas.
Single Click Emergency contact - That connects you to your nearby police station.
